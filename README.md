The pandemic has heavily affected the global economy, and the vaccine has become the most effective way to reverse the situation, especially when there are ongoing variants that continue to affect our daily lives. While it is important to develop strategies to promote vaccines, it is very important to examine whether the strategy would be effective or not. On the other hand, an efficient communication way would help the university to communicate such health issues. Findings from this research can contribute to enhancing the level of community immunity over COVID-19, which can be replicated in other communities. Furthermore, Columbia University can advance their communication strategies with their students when eliciting actions.

# Research Questions and Hypotheses

There are a total of four research questions in this experiment:

1. Does incentive increase booster uptake rates? The null hypothesis is that booster uptake rates in the group with incentive will be the same with that in a group without incentive. The alternative hypothesis is that the booster uptake rate in the incentive group is significantly different than that in the group without incentive.
Br_In: booster uptake rate with Incentive ; Br_noIn: booster uptake rate without incentive H0: Br_In = Br_noIn ; HA: Br_In ≠ Br_noIn

2. Does incentive elicit a faster response? The null hypothesis for this research question is that the response time in the incentive group will be the same as that in the non-incentive group. The alternative hypothesis is that the response time in the incentive group is significantly different than that in the non-incentive group.
t_In: Response time with Incentive ; t_noIn: Response time without incentive H0: t_In = t_noIn ; HA: t_In ≠ t_noIn

3. Is text messaging more effective than email in getting students to take the booster shots? The null hypothesis for this research question is that booster uptake rates in the text group will be the same with that in the email group. The alternative hypothesis is that booster uptake rates in the text group is significantly different than that in the email group.
Br_txt: booster uptake rate when text messaging was used for notification ; Br_email: booster uptake rate when email notification was used H0: Br_txt = Br_email ; HA: Br_txt ≠ Br_email

4. Do students respond faster to text messaging compared to email? The null hypothesis for this research question is that the response time in the text group will be the same with the response time in the email group. The alternative hypothesis is that the response time in the text group is significantly different than the response time in the email group.
t_txt: Response time when text messaging was used for notification ; t_email: Response time when email notification was used H0: t_txt = t_email ; HA: t_txt ≠ t_email
